When photographer Alan Grant visited her family’s farm near Fort Davis, he found the girl holding her own atop her 25-year-old horse, Toy Boy.

                                    For over 100 years, rodeo has been enjoyed by many in the state of California. Recently, there has been a lot of talk in regards to banning rodeo in many California cities. Rodeo is already banned in Napa County, Pasadena, and San Fransisco. Other California cities such as Los Angeles are trying to push forward with this ban.
